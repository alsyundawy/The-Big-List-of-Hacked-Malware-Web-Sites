Most site owners are unaware their sites have been hacked and are being used to plant malware.

Some of the sites on the list are purposefully planting malware on their sites and luring people to click links in emails or social links. Some sites are merely wordpress sites that have been hacked and could contain malware.

Unfortunately to protect the public I have decided to start posting each and every one I find in this list.

# If you find your domain name or web site in <a href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/The-Big-List-of-Hacked-Malware-Web-Sites/blob/master/hacked-domains.list">this list</a>

Your web site has been compromised / hacked and is being used to push out malware to unsuspecting internet users or to redirect users to another web site with malware, ransomware, pornography or other unsavoury things, OR your web site is listed here because you are actually  purposefully hosting a web site with malware, viruses, ransomware or trojans.

<a href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/The-Big-List-of-Hacked-Malware-Web-Sites/blob/master/.input_sources/hacked-malware-websites.txt">All listings on this list</a> are shown with the complete url and files that have been planted and are being used to push out malware or redirect visitors to your site to a completely different web site.

This will help you and your web designer in being able to look for these files, delete them and then look further into your web site directories and sub-directories for other deceptive files that have been planted by hackers.

# Get your web site fixed or cleaned

[![Contact me for help](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contact%20-%20me%20for%20help%20%F0%9F%9A%91-blue.svg)](mailto:mitchellkrog@gmail.com) or someone else who can help you clean up and secure your web site.

The list shows which files have been planted on your site so it makes it easier for you to look for them and clean your site.

Simply deleting those malware files is not enough you have to find out from an expert how they got into your web site in the first place because if you do not fix that problem they will be back and you also have no idea what else they have planted inside directories or sub-directories on your web site.
************************************************
# My web site has been fixed please remove my site !!

Once I confirm your site is clean and safe it will be removed.
